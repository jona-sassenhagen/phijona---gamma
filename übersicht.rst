Coordinates of gamma-band activity

Study                       Space	  Frequency	  Time		    Condition
---------------------  			------	----------	---------	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hagoort et al 2004	          Fz		35-45	    	300-800		World Knowledge Violation, but not Control (50% cloze) or Semantic Violation
Hald et al 2006		            F4?		35-45		    0-600		  Control (50% cloze), but not Semantic Violation
Penolazzi etal 2009	          ? 		30-100		  0-512?		Control > Semantic Violation
Urrutia et al 2012	          F3		80-90		    300-800		Factual, but not counterfactual
Rommers et al 2013	          CPz?	55-70   		200-1000	Control, but not (unrelated) Semantic Violations
Wang et al 2012		            Pz		40-50		    0-1200		Control (68% cloze), but not Control (? < 68%) or Semantic Violation



Hagoort et al. 2004 and Hald et al. 2006 may be the same experiment, with the exclusion of a condition by Hald et al. 2006. Bastiaansen et al. 2012 write that the stimuli in this experiment, not differentiating between Hagoort et al 2004 and Hald et al 2006, lead to an increase in the gamma band for Control, but not Semantic Violation. However, Hagoort et al. 2004 explicitly state that no difference was observed in Control.


Possible methodological differences
- larger Baseline (350 msec average for Bastiaansen, over 1 sec for us), which if at all provides a more robust estimate
- Low-pass filter (we used no high-pass filter and a 125 hz sampling rate; though note that Hagoort et al. 2004 and Hald et al. 2006 apply a 70 hz low pass! Wang et al. and Sommers et al. 2012 use 100 and 125 hz respectively)
- ICA artifact correction (we rejected non-dipolar ICs, which is assumed to attenuate muscle artifacts)
- We use Wavelet filtering, some studies used multi-taper/FFT
- We do not apply a cluster technique to control type I errors, but rather derive hypotheses from independent data sets
- Our protocol features substantially higher power (due to lack of multiple comparison control and higher n, < 200 vs. 24+30+24)
- We do not believe methodological differences are substantial


Possible differences in material
- our sentences span the whole range of observed gamma band differences, including multiple experiments including high- and low-cloze contexts and violations in high- and low-cloze contexts. Every experiment features at least a congruent control and an incongruent comparison

Cluster Correction may be inappropriate for cortical gamma-band activity in general since gamma is known to be synchronized only very focally {vonStein:2000wf}{DuunHenriksen:2013gn}, and Cluster Correction is highly sensitive to distributed effects, while being insensitive to focal effects (Groppe et al., 2011)
